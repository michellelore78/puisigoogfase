                Whilst sentimental rhymes and rather sappy doggerel fills many a mothering sunday greetings card, these ten poems represent some of the best statements about.

    <h3>The following is a list of the top 100 most famous poems of all time in the english language.</h3>
    <p>Missing someone isn&#039;t about how long since you&#039;ve seen them or the amount of time you&#039;ve talked them. In fact, when you miss someone, your mind seems incapable of thinking of anyone or anything else. You will miss someone only if you have a lot of affection and love on her or him. Obviously you miss the deceased, but how can you make your poem an interesting and unique tribute to that person?</p>
